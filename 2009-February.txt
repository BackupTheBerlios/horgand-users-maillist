Subject: [horgand-users] Can't get 1.14 or 1.15 to run
Message-ID: <411755.49012.qm@web36208.mail.mud.yahoo.com>


I searched all over the web trying to find methods for getting horgand 1.14 to work and came up with nothing but useless non relative information. For example, the errors I was running into led me to this message:

http://lalists.stanford.edu/lau/2007/10/0578.html

Well, none of that helped because I even tried building version 1.14 on a system that never had any packaged version of horgand installed on it and I still got the same errors. I figured I'd try the CVS version, but it still yielded the exact same results.

FWIW, I don't have a ~/.fltk directory, nor do I have an horgand.prefs anywhere on my hard drive. So, exactly what is the trick to compiling version 1.14 or 1.15 on a clean system and having it work with JACK?

Well .... I really dont know if you have problems in order to compile the program or at the runtime ..... please send me all the info, including your distro, fltk version and all can help to diagnostique where is the problem.
